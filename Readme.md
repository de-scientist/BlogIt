## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run **Bloggit** locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js** (v18+)
* **npm** or **yarn**
* **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/de-scientist/BlogIt.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Bloggit.git)
    cd Bloggit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (Frontend & Backend):**
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies (e.g., in a 'server' directory)
    cd server
    npm install 
    # Or yarn install
    
    # Install frontend dependencies (e.g., in a 'client' directory)
    cd ../client
    npm install
    # Or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your `server` directory and add your configurations (e.g., database connection string, JWT secret, etc.):
    ```
    # .env example for the backend
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key
    ```
    * ***Note:*** *You may also need a `.env` file for your frontend.*

4.  **Run the Application:**

    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm run start # Or yarn start
        ```
    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm run dev # Or yarn dev
        ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).
